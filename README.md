# Code for "A Span-level Bidirectional Network for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction"

A pytorch version of  the EMNLP 2022 Paper "A Span-level Bidirectional Network for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction" https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12674



## Cautions.
1. This code corresponds to the manuscript article in emnlp2022 and differs only slightly from the article "Span-level Bidirectional Cross-attention Framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction" on Arxiv.

2. This code has many experimental settings that are not mentioned in the paper, so please choose your experimental settings in run.py carefully during the re-creation.
